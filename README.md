## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/mohdkashifansari/Sepsis_Activity_and_time_prediction.git

 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Sepsis_Activity_and_time_prediction

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Data Cleaning & Feature Selection

The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure meaningful features are used for training:

- **Data Loading:** Importing the Sepsis event log into a dataframe.
- **Feature Selection:** Dropping irrelevant columns and filtering cases to focus on essential attributes.
- **Activity Flow Processing:** Ensuring all cases start with ER Registration.
- **Visualization:** Scatter plots are used to examine activity counts and remove rare cases.
- **Attribute Processing:** Extracting important attributes like Biomarkers (Leucocytes, CRP, Lactic Acid).
- **Correlation & SHAP Analysis:** Identifying the most relevant features using correlation analysis and SHAP values.

## Model Training

Once the data is preprocessed, machine learning models are trained to predict:
- **Next Activity** in the patientâ€™s journey.
- **Remaining Time** until treatment completion.

The training process includes:
- Selecting the best-performing model.
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy.
